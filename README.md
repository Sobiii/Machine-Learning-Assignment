# Speech Recognition Machine Learning Project

## Speech Recognition Models for Speaker and Environment Classification

### Overview
This repository contains two targeted speech recognition models:

#### Basic
1) **Recording Environment Classification**: Identifies the environment where the recording took place.<br>
The models are engineered using the MLEnds Sounds dataset and utilize a variety of Machine Learning techniques for optimal performance.<be>

#### Advanced
2) **Speaker Gender Identification**: Classifies the gender of the speaker.<br>

### Highlights
Dataset: MLEnds Sounds<br>
Algorithms Used: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest<br>
Feature Selection: Strategic feature selection techniques applied for performance improvement.<br>
Hyperparameter Optimization: Utilized Grid Search to optimize model parameters.<br>
Performance: Achieved a high F1-score of 86.63%.<br>
